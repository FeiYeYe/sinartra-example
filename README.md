# Example Sinartra app

This is an example [sinartra](https://github.com/hadley/sinartra)
application. 

Navigate to the root of this repository after cloning.
You can then run a server using `Rscript run.R`. Try
accessing the following URLs.

```
http://localhost:8103/first/route?a=1
http://localhost:8103/second/route?a=1
http://localhost:8103/third/route?a=1
http://localhost:8103/fourth/route?a=1
```

You can see they correspond exactly to the [four routes](https://github.com/robertzk/sinartra-example/blob/master/run.R#L35-L39).
